key pressed: ```<up><enter>```

The ```ssh cs15lwi23aus@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` command is 1 up in the search history. Since I don't have to type my password for it, it logs into my account automatically


**Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**

key pressed: ```git clone <ctrl v><enter>```

Since ```git clone``` is a short command, I just type it out. I've already copied the url for the repository, so I only need to type ```<ctrl v>``` to paste it.


**Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**

key pressed: ```cd l<Tab><enter>```, ```<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```, ```<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```

First I cd into the lab7 directory. I use ```<Tab>``` after I type ```l``` and it auto-fills the rest for me. The command ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core 1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` is 9 up in the search history, so I use ```<up>``` to access it. I do the same thing to find the command ```java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests```
