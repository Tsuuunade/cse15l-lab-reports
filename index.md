## Step 1: Installing VScode


Here's the link for the instructions about downloading VScode: https://code.visualstudio.com/. Since I've already had my VScode downloaded on my laptop, I skipped this step. However, for those who don't have VScode yet, remember to restrictly follow the steps and check whether you can open VScode. When it's installed on your laptop, you should be able to see an interface like the following picture.

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting


There are a bunch of things you need to get your remote connection. Steps include:

* **Installing git for Windows**

  **Remark:If your are using a Mac, just ignore this step. This step is only for the one who's using Windows.**


  You need to first install git here: https://gitforwindows.org/. Onced you've installed, you have to link the git to your VScode. How you can do this could be found   on the following website [Using bash for Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994). After you've done, make sure you could see bash here:
